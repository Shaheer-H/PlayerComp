Main Issues:

    Some players from past seasons are not available
    Player search is shotty, need to make searching easier. 
        ex/ LeBron James -> player not found
            James -> player found

    For some reason past players not found:
        ex/ Season: 2018, player: Eden Hazard -> player not found

    There is no meaningfull calculation with the similarity score right now. 
    A proper evaluation function must be developed, using all advanced matrics.
    

    We need to compile a dataset to eventually train a model on. similarity score is a bit Mickey
    Discussion on what kind of model we use must take place.
 

a sample of the tree for football is given in samplefut.txt

run this command to grab the sats for a given player:

Basketball: py -c "import getstat; print(getstat.get_basketball_player_stats(player_id='236', season='2020'))"

Football: python -c "import getstat; print(getstat.get_football_player_stats(search='Salah', season='2022'))"
