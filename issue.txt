The main issue right now is that i cannot grab the stats for a player like goals assists etc. 
Im not sure i just know that it has to do with the way that we navigate the dictionary thats returned when you call for a player
 

a sample of the tree for football is given in samplefut.txt

run this command to grab the sats for a given player:

Basketball: py -c "import getstat; print(getstat.get_basketball_player_stats(player_id='236', season='2020'))"

Football: python -c "import getstat; print(getstat.get_football_player_stats(search='Salah', season='2022'))"

Big issue: right now BBal search query does not allow for player search by name rather only id, we need to find a way to convert a name into id.
